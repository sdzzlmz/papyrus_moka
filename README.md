			Moka
--------------------------------------------------------
Moka is a Papyrus module for execution of UML models, 
which natively includes an execution engine complying 
with OMG standards foundational UML (fUML) and Precise
Semantics of UML Composite Structures (PSCS). These 
standards deal with execution semantics of UML. Moka
is integrated with the Eclipse debug framework to 
provide control, observation and animation facilities
over executions. Moka can be easily extended to support
alternative execution semantics, and thereby be adapted
to multiple usage scenarios and domains.
